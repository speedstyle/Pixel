##Moderation Setup
Similar to the `p!addmod` command, you may add moderator roles with the `p!addmod @Moderators 1`. The number following the role was the permission level of that moderation role. 

There are currently three permission levels: 1: Moderator, 2: Administrator, 3: Owner. Each permission level allows you access to a group of commands, Moderation, Administration and Owners, respectively.

If you want Pixel to log the use of any moderation commands in a channel, use the `p!setmodlog #logs` command.
